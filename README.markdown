Marvin - an evented ruby IRC library
------------------------------------

Welcome to the home of Marvin - a ruby library (usable as a framework) for working with IRC
in an evented fashion. This app is currently undergoing major changes and master is used to
reflect ongoing development. If you'd like to play with an older version, checkout the
_v0.4.0_ tag or the _legacy_ branch. Thanks!
